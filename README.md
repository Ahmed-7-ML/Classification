# Classification
My Project : Breast Cancer Classification Model
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on input features. The dataset used in this project contains medical records and diagnostic measurements to predict the likelihood of breast cancer in patients.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. The dataset contains 569 instances of various diagnostic measurements of breast cancer cells, along with a target variable that indicates whether a tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

Features:
    Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc. (total of 30 features)
    Target: Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
